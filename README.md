## Install Dependencies
We assume a python version that is greater than `3.8.0` is installed in the user's 
machine.

In the root directory of this repo, we provide a `requirememt.txt` file for the
ease of installation.

To install the necessary dependency, one can first start a virtual environment
by doing the following: 
```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```
The above should activate a new python virtual environments.

Then, one can make use of the `requirement.txt` by 
```
pip3 install -r requirement.txt
```
This should install all the required dependencies of this project. 

### Obtaining Dataset.

In this project, we make use of the Imagenet dataset, 
in particular, we use the ILSVRC-2012 version. 

To obtain the Imagenet dataset, one can submit a request through this [link](https://image-net.org/request).

Once the dataset is obtained, place the `.tar` files for training set and validation set both under the root directory of this repo. 

Then use the following procedure to unzip Imagenet dataset:
```
mkdir train && mv ILSVRC2012_img_train.tar train/ && cd train
tar -xvf ILSVRC2012_img_train.tar && rm -f ILSVRC2012_img_train.tar
find . -name "*.tar" | while read NAME ; do mkdir -p "${NAME%.tar}"; tar -xvf "${NAME}" -C "${NAME%.tar}"; rm -f "${NAME}"; done
cd ..
# Extract the validation data and move images to subfolders:
mkdir val && mv ILSVRC2012_img_val.tar val/ && cd val && tar -xvf ILSVRC2012_img_val.tar
``` 

## Running Experiment

The project is divided into three parts, `quantization_scripts`, `retraining_scripts` and `adhoc_quantization_scripts`. The main project uses only the `quantization_scripts`.  We detail the procedure in for running experiments using files provided in `quantization_scripts` in this section. The other two parts of the project are very similar to what we stated here.  

Before getting started, run in the root directory of the repo, run `mkdir models`
to create a directory in which we will store the quantized model. 

The entry point of the project starts with `quantization_scripts/quantize.py`. 
Once the file is opened, there is a hyperparameter section for one to specify the 
batch size that is used for quantization, the scalar of each type of the layers,
the percentile for each type of layers, and etc. One can specify the hyperparameters that will be used in this quantization experiment. 

One thing to note is the  `model_name` parameter. This `model_name` should be the same as the model that you try to quantize. After you selected a `model_name`, assuming you are still in the root directory of this repo, run `mkdir models/{model_name}`, where the `{model_name}` should be the string value that you provided for the `model_name` parameter in the `quantize.py` file. If the directory already exists, you can skip this step. 

Then navigate to the `logs` directory and run `python3 init_logs.py`. This will prepare a log file which is used to store the results of the experiment.

Lastly, navigate into the `quantization_scripts` directory, run `python3 quantize.py` to start the experiment.
